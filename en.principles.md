## Principle of action

###### action

No matter what problem we face, at any time we think about the problem, there is one thing we can do or decide that improves our situation with respect to the problem.

The idea of the principle of action is to build our model of the world around the assumption that we have control over the problems that affect us.

If we have no power over the manifestation of the problem we are facing, the problem may require us to change ourselves; to adapt.

Let's not get defensive.

## Principle of responsability

###### responsability

Each member of a group **always** has a share of merit in the success of the group. Merit is **always** shared among **all** members of the group. Corollary: Merit is **never** given to _only_ one person.

Each member of a group **always** has a share of responsibility in the failures of the group. One person is **never** _only_ responsible for the failure of a group; the responsibility is **always** shared among **all** members of the group.

Note: the principle of responsibility stems from the principle of action.

## Principle of habits

_(presentation to be worked on)_

###### habits

- Habits are usually a good thing. They help to do the things and to decide fast, without getting tired.
- To have habits is good. If you think that it's bad then you're wrong. What is bad is to not be able to change habits when it's necessary.
  - If you don't have any habit then you're must change.
- There are methods to change habits with more ease.

- Les habitudes sont généralement de bonnes choses, elles aide à faire les choses et à décider vite et sans se fatiguer.
- Avoir des habitudes c'est bien. Si vous pensez que c'est mal vous vous trompez. Ce qui est mal c'est de ne pas arriver à changer ses habitues lorsque c'est nécessaire. (changer = créer / modifier / retirer)
- Il existe des méthodes pour changer ses habitudes plus facilement.

### Méthode de changement des habitudes et rituels

###### methode habitude

- Write the list of the things that are done during the ritual
- Change the list according to the observed needs
- Associate a physical object to each action
- Schedule a time
- Plan a time, before the execution of the ritual, to gather the objects, if possible several hours in advance

_Adapt this method to yourself_

## Principle of strength

- It is good to be strong
- Let's hope to be strong in our decision to try to _do_, but let's accept that we sometimes aren't.
  - Let's hope that the attempts that we have decided are fruitful, but let's accept that they may not be.

## Principle of listening and availability (studied)

###### listening

- To listen requires to be "available"
- To listen actively is tiresome at the start (to be discussed)

## Principle of refusal

###### refusal

It is normal to tell no. Tell yes to a thing often implies telling no to another.

- If you feel the need or the duty to say yes to requests, remember this principle.

## PIDARP - Principle of integration-derivation with prioritized responses (studied)

###### pidarp

- Lorsqu'un problème ou une "chose à faire" est identifiée,
- Chercher d'éventuels "prédécésseurs" de cette chose à faire
  - Chercher d'éventuels prédécésseurs de ces prédécesseurs (rare)
- Chercher d'éventuels "corolaire" de cette chose à faire
  - Chercher d'éventuels corolaires de ces corolaires (rare)
- Prioriser les "choses à faire"
  - Identifier la "choses à faire" la plus importante
  - Identifier la seconde plus importante
  - Les écrire si beaucoups de chose à faire sont importantes
- Pour réaliser effectivement ces "choses à faire", commencer par se concentrer sur comment réaliser la chose à faire la plus importante.

## Principle of self-judgment

###### judgement

Having full confidence in our comprehension of the perception of the things relating to a person (i.e. when this person is ourselves or close family), the judgement of past decision must be relative to the perceptions which guided these decisions, rather than relative to the results.

## Principle of pride (to be improved, rephrased)

###### pride

- It is important to feel pride
- Il y a du bonne orgueil et du mauvais orgueil
  - Le mauvais orgueil serais de refuser de changer
  - Ou de refuser de préter son attention
  - Ou de refuser d'écouter
  - (Note: Il y a certain cas ou les refus ci-dessus sont valables)

## Principle of power (new, and being worked on)

###### power

- Power and responsibility are synonymes
- Responsibility and power are synonymes

## Principle of context (empty for now)

###### context

Principle enmpty for now, but I feel like there's something to be found there.
